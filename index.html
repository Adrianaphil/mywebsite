            <h1 class= "headingMain">Adriana Alcaraz Sánchez</h1>
            <p>I’m a <b>Juan de la Cierva Postdoctoral Researcher at the University Pompeu Fabra</b>, working as part of<a href="https://www.upf.edu/web/inact">INACT (Inner Speech in Action)</a> research group. Prior to this, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Humanities (University of Edinburgh) and a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Centre for Philosophical Psychology (University of Antwerp). My academic background includes a BA(Hons) in Psychology and an MSc in Cognitive Science, both from the University of Barcelona. I completed my MPhil and PhD in Philosophy at the University of Glasgow.</p>
            <p>My research aims to provide a clearer understanding of the nature of consciousness by examining the phenomenology of altered states of consciousness across sleep and wakefulness. In recent years, I have been more focused on investigating the links between disordered thoughts, imagination and dreaming.</p>
            <p>I’m an interdisciplinary philosopher, and my approach to studying consciousness combines traditional philosophical methods, such as conceptual analysis, with methods from the social sciences, including qualitative research. I also draw upon various philosophical traditions, including analytic philosophy, phenomenology, and Eastern philosophy, as well as research from empirical sciences like cognitive psychology and neuroscience. For examples of my work, see the <a href="Pages/myresearch.html">Research section.</a> </p>
            <p>I’m always eager to connect and collaborate with other researchers working on similar or related topics, so feel free to get in touch. I’m committed to making academia a more inclusive and accessible environment, and I’m keen to act as a mentor to students and recent graduates, providing informal advice on topics related to my research or job applications.
