            <p>I’m a <b>Postdoctoral Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Studies in the Humanities (IASH) at the University of Edinburgh</b>. Prior to this, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Centre for Philosophical Psychology at the University of Antwerp, Belgium. I completed my PhD at the University of Glasgow in August 2023. My academic background includes a BA(Hons) in Psychology and an MSc in Cognitive Science, both from the University of Barcelona.</p>
            <p>My research aims to provide a clearer understanding of the nature of consciousness by examining the phenomenology of certain altered states of consciousness. In particular, my research has focused on the examination of sleep experiences, including dreaming, as well as other more “minimal” forms of consciousness, such as “dreamless sleep” experiences as described in Indian philosophical traditions. I have also investigated the links between altered states across sleep and waking, including meditative states, deep absorption, and sensory deprivation.</p>
            <p>I’m an interdisciplinary philosopher, and my approach to studying consciousness combines traditional philosophical methods, such as conceptual analysis, with methods from the social sciences, including qualitative research. I also draw upon various philosophical traditions, including analytic philosophy, phenomenology, and Eastern philosophy, as well as research from empirical sciences like cognitive psychology and neuroscience. For examples of my work, see the <a href="Pages/myresearch.html">Research section.</a> </p>
            <p>I’m always eager to connect and collaborate with other researchers working on similar or related topics, so feel free to get in touch. I’m committed to making academia a more inclusive and accessible environment, and I’m keen to act as a mentor to students and recent graduates, providing informal advice on topics related to my research or job applications.
